  Lagomorphica:
  - balance: Warrior archetype now affects Protean claws, Lasombra tentacles, Tzimisce
      armblade/whips, Gangrel war forms, Setite snake form, Tzimisce horror form,
      and all Garou/Corvax transformations, halving the delay after attacking for
      all of them. The additional knockdown chance has been lost, though (as small
      as it was).
  - code_imp: Changes the usage of CLICK_CD_RANGE as the stand-in for Warrior to be
      CLICK_CD_MELEE * 0.5 for more readability and to be more obvious. Also converts
      it from a variable to a trait.
