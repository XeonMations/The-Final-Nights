  - rscadd: "Adds Thaumaturgy paths 'Lure of Flames' and 'Path of Levinbolt', unlocked via collecting and accruing research into Blood Magic by collecting spellbooks, identifying artifacts, and turning them into the Chantry Archives"
  - rscadd: "Mitigates occult artifact 'stacking' by introducing exponential decay for each subsequent artifact collected"
  - rscadd: "Tremeres, when researching blood magic, can gift each other their research if they so wish, or, if they anger the Regent, have their research seized from them"
  - rscadd: "Artifacts now spawn in wooden crates found throughout the map, Path Spellbooks can be found in random bookshelves"
  - rscadd: "New Artifact 'Bloodstone' has been added, allowing a Thaumaturge to track its location when identified"
