changes:
  - balance: "Warrior archetype now affects Protean claws, Lasombra tentacles, Tzimisce armblade/whips, Gangrel war forms, Setite snake form, Tzimisce horror form, and all Garou/Corvax transformations, halving the delay after attacking for all of them. The additional knockdown chance has been lost, though (as small as it was)."
  - code_imp: "Changes the usage of CLICK_CD_RANGE as the stand-in for Warrior to be CLICK_CD_MELEE * 0.5 for more readability and to be more obvious. Also converts it from a variable to a trait."
