Bone round in melody and word layed in rain.
Cemetery runoff congealing at the door.
Maggots love you. Trust me.
Mast lay shrouded and the moon is melting.
Try the corpse in the oven with peppers and fur.
Souls draped in rotten tatters and Father dances in the dark.
Make the tallow from the fat of a hangman.
Evil crouches.
Death.
DIE!
I smell a rancid grave.
You're in for it now.
Rustling robes of the Reaper.
They're coming.
All are blind whose eyes are closed.
Look at it, bent like a calf for the butcher.
The drove is a terrible mistress.
Whishes and words sprout from the same seed.
A dark light from your death.
Hemlock for the deceivers.
It casts a crooked shadow.
It has two mouths to lick from.
Deep of the Atlantic, the Ark, dreaming, sleeping.
Elkabo, elkabo, pixy queen where all is green.
Can't see, can't see! Where have my eyes gone to?
Heloise said you. Cranberry sauce. Hotel foxtrot.
Stop doing that. Mother shan't be too pleased. None too pleased.
It's a tangle of asps.
Those lips bleed a putrid poison.
Sealed with the kiss of swine.
Rat tails, cat tails, coat tails, all tales.
A trick with two tongues.
It's not fair! I wanted to.
Pennies for your eyes in its pockets.
Why is it troubled?
Ask about the free arsenic.
Blood brings the vicious beast.
I see daggers hang on his breath.
The very thought falls to the flame.
